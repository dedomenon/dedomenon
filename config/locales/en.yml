    <h2>What is MyownDB?</h2>
    <p>Myowndb is a web application with the goal to let you manage your data easily. You can view it as a database with which you get an interface to enter, modify, delete and search data once you've define its structure.</p>
    <div id="signup_frame"> <a href="/app/authentication/signup">Sign up!</a></div>
    
    <h2>What are the advantages?</h2>
    <p>MyOwnDB has several advantages compared to usual applications:
    <ul>
    <li><b>web-based</b>: this means that your data is <i>accessible</i> from anywhere: your work, your home, your hotel. Further development of the application will also let you <i>share your data</i> easily.</li>
    <li><b>multi-user</b>: you can manage users having access to the application. And no need to have them present in the next cubicle: just enter their email address and they'll get instructions sent to them!</li>
    <li><b>easy to configure</b>: All you need is a browser to take advantage of the application as a user (manipulating the data) or as an administrator (defining the structure of the data).</li>
    <li><b>easy to use</b>: the application has been developed to make entering, searching and organising data easy. Getting to the functionality you need shouldn't take more than 2 clicks!</li>
    <li><b>multi-lingual</b>: not everybody speak english, and the application's interface is multi-lingual, with french and english currently available. data definitions (table names, field names,...) will soon also be definable in multiple languages.</li>
    <li><b>integrated help</b>: Helping text is integrated in the interface to help you master the tool rapidly. Once the help becomes unnecessary, you can deactivated it in your settings.</li>

class Entities2Detail < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :detail
  belongs_to :entity

  # The database table contains the status_id field that should be linked
  # with the detail_status table's id field, but there is no relationship
  # either at the table level or at the object level. I am adding
  # The relationships at both levels.

  belongs_to :detail_status
  def self.table_name
    "entities2details"
  end
end

# This was introduced in an upgrade of Rails, where it complained that the class Entities2detail was not defined
# The simplest solution was to define it here. It is never used in the code though, as only Entities2Detail was used before this upgrade.
# Entities2detail should never be used!
Entities2detail = Entities2Detail

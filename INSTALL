Here are simplified installation instructions.

The latest and most complete installation instructions are available on the
Dedomenon wiki at http://www.dedomenon.org/wiki/dedomenon/Installing_Dedomenon

Prerequisites:
--------------

You should have the following software installed (ubuntu package names):
ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev irb rake rubygems build-essential postgresql-8.2
postgresql-contrib-8.2 libpgsql-ruby1.8 libz-dev libpng-dev libgd2-xpm-dev

The following ruby gems are also necessary:
ruby-debug json captcha ruby-gd sources termios

We recommend the use of the latest Git version available from http://git.or.cz/
The easiest way to install Dedomenon is using sudo, so we recommend that also

Getting the software
--------------------

Get the software by cloning our Git repository:

git clone git://dedomenon.org/dedomenon

Preparing your system
---------------------
Configure sudo so you can execute some commands as the postgres user (the
default postgresql super user in Debian and Ubuntu):
as root, execute the command
  visudo
and add this line to the file that is presented by visudo:
YOURLOGIN ALL=(postgres) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/psql, /usr/bin/createdb, /usr/bin/createuser

Set up of Dedomenon
-------------------
After that, you can go in the dedomenon directory and run this command to set
everything up:
  rake dedomenon:setup

This command configures the application in the production environment, and you
can start the server with this command:
  ruby script/server --environment=production

This way of running the application is good for testing. Once you go into
production, you should use more efficient ways of running Dedomenon (for
example with Mongrel).

Clean things up
---------------
you can run visudo again and remove the line we added earlier, it is not needed
anymore.

      # Here we are using the Foreign Key Migrations plugin available from
      # http://www.redhillonrails.org/. This plug in is installed in
      # vendor/plugin directory. if you see any column colname_id with options
      # of :references, on_update then you can safely assume that this plugin
      # is being utilized. The benifit of this plugin is that it generates
      # The foriegn key constrainst automatically which at time time of writing,
      # Rails does not.

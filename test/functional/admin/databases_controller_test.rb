  # *Description*
  #   Basically here we test whether we can reach the databases when
  #   We are an admin user?
  #   
  #   *Strategy*
  #     First we load a user from the fixtures and execute a
  #     +get+ call with a session data of 'user' => loadedFixture user
  #     And account ID to be user.account_id
  #     The we expect following:
  #        * The responce code should be success
  #        * The rendered template should be 'list'
  #        
  #

    assert_equal 4, assigns["databases"].length
  end

  # *Description*
  #   We are testing to list the database as a non admin user.
  #
  # *Strategy*
  #   We get the index page with setting the session variable 
  #   'user' as a non admin user from the fixture data.
  #   Then we expect following:
  #     * The response is redirect
  #     * We are redirected to database controller

  #   We try to list the database with an incorrect user.

  #   We try to create a new database with a correct user.

  #   We hit the new action with setting the session variables of user and
  #   the account_id.
  #   We expect following:

  #     * There is a tag <input type="text" name="database[name]">

  # *Description*
  #   We test to create a new database with a correct user.

  #     We obtaint the database count and then fire the post action on create
  #     action of the controller admin/databases with a database parameter hash
  #     containing the name of the database along with settign the session
  #     variable user to the user.
  #     Afterwards, we obtain the databse coutn again.
  #     We expect the following:
  #       * Response is to redirect
  #       * We are redirected to DatabasesController#list
  #       * The difference between the pre and post database count is 1

  # *Description*
  #   We try to create a database with a correct user whose account limit is 
  #   reached.
  #   
  #  *Strategy*
  #   We get the database count then we invoke then we invoke the 
  #   DatabasesController#create with post method. The controller parameter
  #   of the request is set to admin/databases and setting the
  #   database parameter to a hash containing the name of the database.
  #   The session variable user is set to the user with an account limit. 
  #   Afterwards, we again get the database count.
  #   We excpet the following:

  # *Description*
  #   We chekc the DatabasesController#edit action with a correct user.
  #   
  # *Strategy*
  #   We call the GET method on DatabasesController#edit where paramerts include
  #   database id and the session variable user is also set.
  #   We expect following:
  #     * Response is success
  #     * Rendered template is edit.erb

  #     * The @database is valid after editing.

  #   We check the DatabasesController#update method by invoking it through POST

  #     * controller  => admin/databases
  #     * database    => demo_form_updated.
  #   Afterwards, we seek the database count.
  #   We expect the following:
  #     * responce is to redirect
  #     * We are redirected to the action DatabasesController#list
  #     * The name of the database has been changed.
  #     * The datbase count is the same as before the POST

  # *Description*
  #   Here we test to delete a database.
  # 
  # *Strategy*
  #   We obtain the count of databases, entities and detail_values. Then we 
  #   invoke the DatabasesController#destroy by POST. id is the parameter and
  #   session variable user is also set.
  #   We again obtain the count of databases, entiteisa and detail_values 
  #   after deletion.
  #   We expect the following:
  #     * response is to redirect
  #     * We are redirected to DatabasesController#list
  #     * Obtaining the databases deleted raises exception.
  #     * The database, entities and detail_value counts are decremented.
